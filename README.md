# FlverFixer
A Tool built which will fix GX Lists and Buffer Layouts to make sure they match with the materials used by the flver meshes.
### Supported Games
- Dark Souls 3
- Sekiro
- Elden Ring
## Usage
Drag any supported dcx that contains a flver (or multiple flvers) onto the executable.
It will not create a new dcx, the original dcx will be replaced.
